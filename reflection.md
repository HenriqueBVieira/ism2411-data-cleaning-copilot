Copilot generated all the functions in my code, which is the majority of it. I  prompted it by writing an initial simple code that did the data cleaning, and then used copilot to essentially transform everything into functions and clean up the whole code.
I had to modify a lot of the code to fit in with what I had already previously written, and also to make sure all the variable and column names etc. were all matching. I also changed a bit its logic in order to fit in with what I had previously written, although I didn't need to do as much since I used it to create all the functions, meaning the logic was already fairly consistent. I needed to do all of this in order to have a concise (and fairly readable) code.
I learned that data cleaning can be very much simplified with the help of copilot, especially when it comes to writing a neater code. I think its major strength is that it actually gives meaningfull sugestions of code, while its main weakness is that it sometimes fails to adapt other parts of the code. One example of this would be that when creating the function copilot already put in most of the code inside the function, but did not cleanup the outside, such as when it created the def load_data, it left behinf the old code that did this, which caused conflicts. This led to many errors and required manually cleaning up the whole code.
